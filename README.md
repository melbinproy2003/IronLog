# 💪 ForgeAI – Offline AI-Powered Workout Tracker

## 📌 Summary

ForgeAI is a fully offline, AI-assisted workout tracking mobile application built with Flutter.  
It is designed to help strength-focused individuals systematically track workouts, monitor progression, and receive intelligent training suggestions — all without relying on cloud services or paid APIs.

The application combines structured workout logging with rule-based artificial intelligence to simulate a smart strength coach inside your phone.

---

## 🎯 Aim of the Application

The primary aim of ForgeAI is to:

- Provide a structured system for strength and hypertrophy training
- Ensure consistent progressive overload
- Prevent overtraining and fatigue
- Deliver intelligent feedback based on performance trends
- Operate 100% offline with zero operational cost

This app is built for disciplined lifters who want measurable and data-driven progress.

---

## 🏆 Goals of the Application

- Track workouts accurately
- Calculate strength progression metrics
- Detect plateaus and fatigue patterns
- Suggest weight increases or deloads
- Maintain clean architecture for scalability
- Support long-term transformation tracking (e.g., 4-month strength goal)

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

### 📱 Frontend
- Flutter (latest stable version)
- Riverpod (state management)
- fl_chart (data visualization)

### 💾 Local Storage
- Hive (NoSQL local database)
- Path Provider

### 🧠 AI Logic
- Pure Dart rule-based progression engine
- No external AI APIs
- Fully offline logic processing

### 🧱 Architecture
- Clean architecture principles
- Separation of UI and business logic
- Null safety enabled
- Modular folder structure

---

## 🔥 Core Features

### 1️⃣ Workout Logging
- Add exercises
- Log sets (weight + reps)
- Save workout by date
- Persistent local storage

---

### 2️⃣ Strength & Performance Tracking

#### Estimated 1RM Calculation
```

1RM = weight × (1 + reps / 30)

```

#### Weekly Volume Calculation
```

Volume = weight × reps × sets

```

- Personal Record (PR) tracking
- Strength progression monitoring
- Weekly training volume tracking
- Performance trend analysis

---

### 3️⃣ Rule-Based AI Progression Engine

The AI engine analyzes workout history and applies intelligent training rules such as:

- Increase weight if target reps achieved consistently
- Reduce load if performance declines
- Detect fatigue when weekly volume spikes excessively
- Suggest deload if strength drops for consecutive weeks

This logic is implemented entirely in Dart and works offline.

---

### 4️⃣ AI Coach System

The built-in AI Coach:

- Reviews historical performance
- Suggests next workout weight
- Identifies plateaus
- Warns about overtraining
- Recommends recovery strategies
- Suggests accessory work if needed

It functions as a structured digital strength mentor.

---

### 5️⃣ Progress Visualization

- 1RM progression graphs
- Weekly volume graphs
- Performance trend visualization
- Clean minimal UI

---

### 6️⃣ Offline-First Design

- No backend required
- No Firebase
- No cloud dependency
- Zero hosting cost
- Data stored locally on device

---

## 🧠 How the AI Works

ForgeAI does not use external machine learning APIs.

Instead, it uses:

- Deterministic progression algorithms
- Performance comparison logic
- Volume trend analysis
- Strength regression detection

This approach ensures:

- Speed
- Privacy
- Reliability
- Zero cost

Future optional integration may include open-source LLM models (e.g., Mistral via Ollama) for conversational coaching.

---

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

- Open-source LLM integration (optional)
- Multi-user support
- Export workout data (CSV)
- Camera-based form analysis (MediaPipe Pose)
- Cloud sync (optional, if needed)

---

## 🧭 Target Audience

- Strength-focused lifters
- Hypertrophy trainees
- Progressive overload practitioners
- Individuals following structured transformation plans

---

## 💡 Core Philosophy

ForgeAI is built on one principle:

Track everything. Improve intelligently. Train with discipline.

No distractions.  
No fluff.  
Only progression.
```

If you want, I can now:

* Make it more startup-style (for investors)
* Make it more developer-focused (technical documentation style)
* Or make a short professional GitHub description (1–2 paragraph version)
